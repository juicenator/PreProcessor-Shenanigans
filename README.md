# PreProcessor-Shenanigans
Change to state of the program by changing the preprocessor definitions!

This is so stupid...


Be aware that only after restarting your program the definitions will have changed!

Implemented the start of a Tic Tac Toe game.

TODO:
	-A set function
	-Finish Tic Tac Toe
		>Did anyone win?
		>Reset the game state after finish or on first run.
